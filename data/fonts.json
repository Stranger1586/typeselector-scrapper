Unusually this type includes lowercase letters. The high x-height gives the text a compact look, true to the original Cooperplate Gothic design. The general form is less condensed. It has diagonal stress, and a soft variation in contrast to improve legibility. It is bolder than normal for better rasterization on screen. The typeface works smoothly at text sizes with its delicate serifs, which gives a crisp effect on the screen. At larger sizes it shows a strong personality with the combination of serif details and the modulation of its strokes. It is useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen.","Designed by Dario Muhafara for <a href=\"http://www.tipo.net.ar\">tipo foundry</a>."],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"name":"Dario Manuel Muhafara","role":" Principal design ","bio":null}]}},{"variants":["regular"],"version":"v19","lastModified":"2022-01-27","files":{"regular":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/bangers/v19/FeVQS0BTqb0h60ACL5la2bxii28.ttf"},"category":"display","kind":"webfonts#webfont","family":"Bangers","id":"bangers","providers":"google","isVariable":false,"loaded":false,"allVariantsLoaded":false,"scripts":["latin","latin-ext","vietnamese"],"fontMeta":{"hasSpecialText":false,"license":{"name":"Open Font License","url":"https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"},"description":["Bangers is a comicbook style font which packs a punch!

What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.","Motivated by my love for the pixel I designed Bitter. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.","Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is thicker than a normal ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.","Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.","Designed by Sol Matas for <a href=\"http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/\">Huerta Tipográfica</a>"],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iQbc0QMRB7FPBoX9isfXXwrvMV8dcrkYfAQNjvoJCtjed_tFGRhVaN_E3IY=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Huerta Tipográfica","role":" Principal design ","bio":"<p>Argentina</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://huertatipografica.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Huerta Tipográfica</a> is a collaborative Argentinian type foundry with a deep respect for design and typography.

The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond. "," Why another Garamond?

unknown letterer. The distinct and sharp, quirky and attention seeking details inspired Minjoo Ham to use it for a rather uncommon revival project and turn it into a robust, contemporary typeface. Once the Hangeul was finished, Mark Frömberg took on the challenge to translate the characteristics to the Latin design. A lively exploration into the possible and impossible began. Hahmlet is great for any kind of typesetting, print or screen but also a perfect eyecatcher for signage and poster designs. We highly recommend to use it for Hangeul and Latin bilingual typography.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.","Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yOEWQDI2JsxhvWYME_xRj0vrfjr8rcy6Lo9U7HhJJQqNZ21aNZTM_knWrfQ=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Sudtipos","role":" Principal design ","bio":null}]}},{"variants":["regular"],"version":"v15","lastModified":"2022-01-13","files":{"regular":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/hennypenny/v15/wXKvE3UZookzsxz_kjGSfMQqt3M7tMDT.ttf"},"category":"display","kind":"webfonts#webfont","family":"Henny Penny","id":"henny-penny","providers":"google","isVariable":false,"loaded":false,"allVariantsLoaded":false,"scripts":["latin"],"fontMeta":{"hasSpecialText":false,"license":{"name":"Open Font License","url":"https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"},"description":["Henny Penny is an offbeat display font with loads of personality, named in honour of the fairy-tale character chicken Henny Penny.

Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing."," He wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.","Peter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"","John Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"","In 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"name":"Igino Marini","role":" Principal design ","bio":null}]}},{"variants":["100","200","300","regular","500","600","700"],"version":"v5","lastModified":"2021-12-09","files":{"100":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss5AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30L_HaKpHOtFCQ76Q.ttf","200":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss6AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30L_NqrhFmDGC0i8Cc.ttf","300":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss6AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30L_L6ohFmDGC0i8Cc.ttf","500":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss6AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30L_OaphFmDGC0i8Cc.ttf","600":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss6AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30L_MquhFmDGC0i8Cc.ttf","700":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss6AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30L_K6vhFmDGC0i8Cc.ttf","regular":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexsansthailooped/v5/tss_AoJJRAhL3BTrK3r2xxbFhvKfyBB6l7hHT30LxBKAoFGoBCQ.ttf"},"category":"sans-serif","kind":"webfonts#webfont","family":"IBM Plex Sans Thai Looped","id":"ibm-plex-sans-thai-looped","providers":"google","isVariable":false,"loaded":false,"allVariantsLoaded":false,"scripts":["cyrillic-ext","latin","latin-ext","thai"],"fontMeta":{"hasSpecialText":false,"license":{"name":"Open Font License","url":"https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"},"description":[" IBM Plex™ is an international typeface family designed by Mike Abbink, IBM BX&amp;D, in collaboration with Bold Monday, an independent Dutch type foundry.

In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.","In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.","When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.","The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.","Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yOEWQDI2JsxhvWYME_xRj0vrfjr8rcy6Lo9U7HhJJQqNZ21aNZTM_knWrfQ=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Sudtipos","role":" Principal design ","bio":null}]}},{"variants":["regular"],"version":"v11","lastModified":"2022-01-11","files":{"regular":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/montaga/v11/H4cnBX2Ml8rCkEO_0gYQ7LO5mqc.ttf"},"category":"serif","kind":"webfonts#webfont","family":"Montaga","id":"montaga","providers":"google","isVariable":false,"loaded":false,"allVariantsLoaded":false,"scripts":["latin"],"fontMeta":{"hasSpecialText":false,"license":{"name":"Open Font License","url":"https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"},"description":["Montage is an Old Style font, inspired by Venetian calligraphy.

Since 430 CE, the Georgian language used an inscriptional form (Asomtavruli), which evolved into a manuscript form (Nuskhuri). These are categorized as Khutsuri (ecclesiastical): Asomtavruli is uppercase, Nuskhuri is lowercase. Khutsuri is still used for liturgical purposes, but was replaced by a new case-less form (Mkhedruli) used for nearly all modern Georgian writing. In the 1950s, Akaki Shanidze attempted to add Asomtavruli as uppercase and use Mkhedruli for lowercase, but the effort did not succeed.

These are categorized as Khutsuri (ecclesiastical): Asomtavruli is uppercase, Nuskhuri is lowercase. Khutsuri is still used for liturgical purposes, but was replaced by a new case-less form (Mkhedruli) used for nearly all modern Georgian writing. In the 1950s, Akaki Shanidze attempted to add Asomtavruli as uppercase and use Mkhedruli for lowercase, but the effort did not succeed.

"," Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014. Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin and Cyrillic languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback. In 2016 the Latin part of the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar to complete the work started by Vernon. In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis.

I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography &amp; Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal.","Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience.","I wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate.

distinctive geometric slab serifs, sometimes called Egyptians, popular in the late nineteenth and early to mid twentieth centuries. In 1910 the Inland Type Foundry published Litho Antique and similar types were published by American Type Founders in the 1920s and Monotype Corporation in the 1930s. Rokkitt is intended for use as a display font, in headings and headlines, though it can also be used as an alternative to sans serif designs at text sizes.

Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.","The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.","The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.","The Rozha project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

With Indian typefaces, large character sets are often even less common. The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.","Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.","The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.","The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’."],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HSnoeY6FyQyd6EFmIpms55KH5EjGRqCzLAKillb2DqEYsW1wjy0IEyCmrK2r=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Indian Type Foundry","role":" Principal design ","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Type Foundry</a> (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age.","Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do.","Source Serif continues <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe-fonts/\">Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces</a>. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen.","Source Serif is an active Open Source project – if you are interested in contributing, please visit <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe/source-serif-pro\">source-serif-pro</a> on Github for more information."],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"name":"Frank Grießhammer","role":" Principal design ","bio":null}]}},{"variants":{"wghtOnly":{"normal":{"latin-ext":"https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gfbjR61M69yt8Z2QytlBfK.woff2","latin":"https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gfbjR61M69yt8Z2QKtlA.woff2"}}},"version":"v10","lastModified":"2022-02-03","files":{"100":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrGFuG6OChXtf4qS.ttf","200":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrEFuW6OChXtf4qS.ttf","300":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrHbuW6OChXtf4qS.ttf","500":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrG3uW6OChXtf4qS.ttf","600":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrFbvm6OChXtf4qS.ttf","700":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrFivm6OChXtf4qS.ttf","800":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrEFvm6OChXtf4qS.ttf","900":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrEsvm6OChXtf4qS.ttf","regular":"http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spartan/v10/l7gAbjR61M69yt8Z8w6FZf9WoBxdBrGFuW6OChXtf4qS.ttf"},"category":"sans-serif","kind":"webfonts#webfont","family":"Spartan","id":"spartan","providers":"google","isVariable":true,"loaded":false,"allVariantsLoaded":false,"scripts":["latin","latin-ext"],"axes":{"wght":{"default":"400","min":"100","max":"900","step":"1"}},"fontMeta":{"hasSpecialText":false,"license":{"name":"Open Font License","url":"https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"},"description":["An open-source typeface based on early 20th century American geometric sans serifs.

href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro\">Source Sans Pro</a> family. The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age.","Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony.

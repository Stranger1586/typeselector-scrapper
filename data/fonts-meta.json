Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed. "," Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project. "," The Baloo 2 project consists of <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/?query=baloo\">ten font families</a> with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese. "," It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.

What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.","Motivated by my love for the pixel I designed Bitter. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.","Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is thicker than a normal ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.","Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.","Designed by Sol Matas for <a href=\"http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/\">Huerta Tipográfica</a>"],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iQbc0QMRB7FPBoX9isfXXwrvMV8dcrkYfAQNjvoJCtjed_tFGRhVaN_E3IY=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Huerta Tipográfica","role":" Principal design ","bio":"<p>Argentina</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://huertatipografica.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Huerta Tipográfica</a> is a collaborative Argentinian type foundry with a deep respect for design and typography.

The diverse proportions of lowercase and capitals add warmth and appeal to texts across sizes, while the different voices can express a variation in the typographic texture that ranges from delicate in text sizes to exuberant in larger sizes.\n","To contribute, please see <a href=\"https://github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner\">github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner</a>."],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nijFPv703e6xxclU4mBESXlgImhIf0jeq3p1WMwC-ZKRpl2THoyoNvofHA=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Kostas Bartsokas","role":" Principal design ","bio":"<p>\nKostas Bartsokas is a typeface designer and typographer based in Thessaloniki, Greece.

The precise level of contrast was decided by experimenting with various 'colors' of density that emerge in text settings. This allows Esteban to achieve good performance even in medium and low quality prints and as a web font."],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vPU1UiSJXIuYBux2zKm_6pSJAxqdA-CogvPgsXo_9GTnP9nUpc3oMogdpA=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Angélica Díaz","role":" Principal design ","bio":null}],"id":"esteban"},{"license":{"name":"Open Font License","url":"https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"},"description":[" Estonia is based on the calligraphic style found in the east European country of Estonia.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.","In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.","When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.","The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.

I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography &amp; Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal.","Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience.","I wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate.

With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes. "," The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/parametric_axes\">parametric axes</a>. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric axes in <a href=\"https://www.axis-praxis.org/specimens/amstelvar\">Amstelvar Alpha</a> (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at <a href=\"https://variablefonts.typenetwork.com\">variablefonts.typenetwork.com</a> "," The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like <a href=\"https://typetools.typenetwork.com/\">typetools</a> and <a href=\"https://videoproof.typenetwork.com/\">videoproof</a>, which can be used to explore the depth of the design. "," The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers. With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it. "," And none of this would be possible without the long list of contributors involved.

Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.","The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.","The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.","The Rozha project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

With Indian typefaces, large character sets are often even less common. The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.","Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.","The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.","The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’."],"authors":[{"avatar":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HSnoeY6FyQyd6EFmIpms55KH5EjGRqCzLAKillb2DqEYsW1wjy0IEyCmrK2r=w40-h40-fbw=1","name":"Indian Type Foundry","role":" Principal design ","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Type Foundry</a> (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.
